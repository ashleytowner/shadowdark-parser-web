# Shadowdark Parser Web

This is the web version of the shadowdark parser library. It's pretty bare-bones
but it is a much nicer UI for people who don't like the terminal.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get it up & running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashleytowner/shadowdark-parser-web.git
cd shadowdark-parser-web
npm install
npm run start
```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
